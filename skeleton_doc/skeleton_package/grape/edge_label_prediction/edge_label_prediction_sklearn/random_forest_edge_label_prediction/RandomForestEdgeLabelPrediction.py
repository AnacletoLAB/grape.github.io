            smoke_test: bool = False
                Whether this run should be considered a smoke test
                and therefore use the smoke test configurations for
                the provided model names and feature names.
            precompute_constant_automatic_stocastic_features: bool = False
                Whether to precompute once the constant automatic stocastic
                features before starting the embedding loop. This means that,
                when left set to false, while the features will be computed
                using the same input data, the random state between runs will
                be different and therefore the experiment performance will
                capture more of the variance derived from the stocastic aspect
                of the considered method. When set to true, they are only computed
                once and therefore the experiment will be overall faster.
